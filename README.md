Notes about English usage, in and out of technical writing.

## Counfounded Words

This section is about words that can be hard to differentiate, expecially when brains are fuzzy.

### discreet vs. discrete

#### The rule

*    When someone is trying not to draw attention to something, they are being descreet.
*    When a thing is separate and distinct from other things, it is discrete.

#### Trick to remember this

A thing that's dis**crete** can be identified con**crete**ly.
Discr**ee**t people don't want to be s**ee**n.
### into vs. in to

#### The rule

*    When a thing ends up inside another thing, use **into**.
*    When a thing is entering someplace in order to do another thing, use **in to**.

#### Trick to remember this

If you can insert 'in order' between in and to, it's in to: 'Father came in _(in order)_ to chastise them further'.

#### Canonical example

```
The shadowy figure moved into the light.
The shadowy figure moved in to get a closer look at the boy.
```
